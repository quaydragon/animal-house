1. About/Overview. 

THe RHouse java project builds a reptile house that holds different animals, specifically reptiles and amphibians.

2. List of features. 
    -Creating a conservatory that holds the habits, which hold the animals.
    -Creates habitats tailored to the animals in the conservatory. 
    -Creates animals that are either amphibians or reptiles.
        These animals have the features: 
        -Size
        -Lowest Temperature they can live at.
        -Highest temperature they can live at.
        -Their natural feature preference: such as a log or sandy beach.
        -Whether or not they are poisonous.
        -Whether or not they are endangered. 

3. How To Run. Instructions to run the program should include the following:

4. How to run the jar file
cd into the res/ directory in terminal and run:
    java -jar house.jar

5. Description of Example Runs. When providing example runs, describe what each example run does. For example:

Run 1 -- Filename: rhouse.txt:
  1. Runs Driver.java which outputs the example conservatory, with example animals.  
  

6. Changes:

There were significant changes made to the UML design once I started building. I realized how many more functions the AbstractAnimal class should have.

7. Assumptions:

I assumed that we would be using the program to make a reptile house. However, names could be changed for this program to be used to make any type of animal house. 

8. Limitations:
    As of now you can only have an amphibian or reptile as a specified animal class. However, animal allows you to create any type of animal.
    You cannot edit the habitats that the animals inhabit or expand the conservatory. This makes the program inflexible.
